# Chronic-Kidney-Disease
### Overview
This project aims to develop predictive models for identifying Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) using a range of machine learning algorithms. The dataset used includes various features related to patient health indicators, and the models have been trained and tested to determine the most accurate method for predicting CKD.

### Dataset
The dataset contains medical and demographic information, such as:

Patient ID
Age
Gender
Ethnicity
Socioeconomic Status
Education Level
BMI
Smoking, Alcohol Consumption, Physical Activity
Family History (Kidney Disease, Hypertension, Diabetes)
Blood Pressure (Systolic, Diastolic)
Blood Tests (Fasting Blood Sugar, HbA1c, Serum Creatinine, BUN Levels, GFR)
Urinary Tests (Protein In Urine, ACR)
Serum Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Calcium, Phosphorus)
Medication Use (ACE Inhibitors, Diuretics, NSAIDs, Statins, Antidiabetic Medications)
Symptoms (Edema, Fatigue Levels, Nausea/Vomiting, Muscle Cramps, Itching)
Environmental Factors (Water Quality, Heavy Metals Exposure, Occupational Exposure to Chemicals)
Medical Checkups Frequency, Medication Adherence, Health Literacy
### Models Used
The following machine learning models were applied and compared:

Logistic Regression
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels (linear, RBF, polynomial)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
### Key Insights
LDA emerged as the most effective model, achieving the highest accuracy of 0.86.
The performance of other models was also evaluated, but LDA proved to be the most reliable for this specific dataset.
